This project was built to control the collection and distribution of solar energy in my home using water to store and transport the energy. 
The heat is collected VIA evacuated tube solar thermal collectors and is stored in an insulated 600 gallon tank before being transported to 
a distribution manifold where it is used for domestic hot water and domestic heating. The system status along with manual pump control is 
displayed on a webpage using ancient HTML code. While the web interface works it's clunky and relies on refreshing the page for up to date 
temperature sensor and pump status information.
